# api-server

in this lab , we learn how to **refactor** our code ,and we used collection that we can consider it as a library 
that contains function to used accros my code , in order to not repeat the same steps. 

we have followed the same steps for the previous labs and we add to it the following :

- we created a collection class that accepts a sequelize model into the constructor , and in the class we have performed the  CRUD operations
- we created new instances in the collection for the two tables : clothes and food .
- Create a data inside the clothes and food tables using POST , Read a list of data using GET ,Read a specific data using GET ,Update a a record in table using PUT , and destroy a record using DELETE and we did that using postman .
- and before deploying i did test all  the testing Requirements for :404 on a bad route ,and bad method .also for the CRUD methods .
